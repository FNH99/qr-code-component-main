### What I learned

Instead of spending time figuring out the exact size of the image, I found that just setting the aspect ratio to 1:1 works great.

```css
.qr-image {
    aspect-ratio: 1/1;
    max-width: 250px;
    background-image: url("/images/image-qr-code.png");
    background-size: contain;
    border-radius: 5px;

}
```
